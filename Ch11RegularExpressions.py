print('---  Regular Expressions  ---')

# In computing, a regular expression, also referred to as "regex" or 
# "regexp", provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings
#  of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. 
# A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be 
# interpreted by a regular expression processor.

# Really clever "wild card" expressions for matching and parsing strings.

# UNDERSTANDING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
# very powerful and quite cryptic
# fun once you understand them
# Regular expressions are a language unto themselves
# A lannguage of "marker characters" - programming with characters
# It is kind of an "old school" language - compact
