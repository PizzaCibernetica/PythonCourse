# Repeated Steps

n = 5 # n is our iteration variable
while n > 0 :

# Infinite loop is a loop that doesn't exit

# example

n = 5
while n > 0 :
    print("Lather")
    print("Rinse")
    exit() # needed to exit 
print("Dry off!")

# the following loop doesn't iterate at all

# zero trip loop

n = 0
while n > 0 :
    print("Lather")
    print("Rinse")
    exit() # needed to exit 
print("Dry off!")
