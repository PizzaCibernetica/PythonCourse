# Data on the Web

# With the HTTP Request/Response well understood and well supported,
#  there was a natural move toward exchanging data between programs using these protocols
# We needed to come up with an agreed way to represent data going between applications and across networks
# There are two commonly used formats: XML and JSON


# Sending Data Across the “Net”

# a.k.a.  “Wire Protocol” - What we send on the “wire”
# if we monitor the wire we would see this

# Agreeing on a “Wire Format”

# Python Dictionary    => serialize   ==> on the network ==> de-serialize ==> java HashMap
# serialization (or serialisation) is the process of translating a data structure
#  or object state into a format that can be stored or transmitted  in the "wire" and reconstructed later
# wire protocol can be XML, JSON

# JSON is simpler and easier 
# XML is more precize 

# XML - Extensible Markup Language
